# QIC Lib

**QIC Lib** (read 'quick lib') is a toolbox/library of MATLAB functions, useful for anyone who is learning, teaching or doing research in Quantum Information and Computation (QIC). QIC is a fascinating area in physics, computer science and engineering, which I learned and taught for a number of years while I was a professor in Iran.
