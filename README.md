# QIC Lib

**QIC Lib** (read 'quick lib') is a toolbox/library of MATLAB functions, useful for anyone who is learning, teaching or doing research in Quantum Information and Computation (QIC). QIC is a fascinating topic in physics, computer science and engineering, which I learned and taught for a number of years while I was a professor in Iran. Now I am working in industry doing more down-to-earth stuff. 
But I plan to keep adding to QIC Lib as time goes on.

In the meantime, I invite you to read the following Wikipedia pages to know more about QIC:

Also the following book is a great book if if you want to dive deep into this subject:
Nielsen and Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Cambridge University Oress, 2010.
