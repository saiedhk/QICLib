{"name":"Qic Lib","tagline":"QIC Lib: A Quantum Information and Computation Toolbox in MATLAB","body":"# QIC Lib\r\n\r\n**QIC Lib** (read 'quick lib') is a toolbox/library of MATLAB functions, useful for anyone who is learning, teaching or doing research in Quantum Information and Computation (QIC). QIC is a fascinating topic in physics, computer science and engineering, which I learned and taught for a number of years while I was a professor in Iran. Now I am working in industry doing more down-to-earth stuff. \r\nBut I plan to keep adding to QIC Lib as time goes on.\r\nIn the meantime, I invite you to read the following Wikipedia pages to know more about QIC:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing\r\n\r\nAlso the following book is a great book if if you want to dive deep into this subject:\r\n\r\nNielsen and Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Cambridge University Press, 2010.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
